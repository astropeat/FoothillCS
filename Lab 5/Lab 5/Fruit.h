/*
 class Fruit

 Private data members: fruit name (a pointer to character), weight (in lbs), unit price
 Private static field: tax (8.50%)
 
 Constructors:
 Default constructor: set everything to 0 or NULL (for pointer)
 Non-default constructor: take a character array (char [ ] ) and two doubles to initialize the Fruit’s data. 
 You must dynamically allocate memory for the fruit name data
 
 Copy constructor: provide a copy constructor as this class has pointers as data members 
 (In fact all classes defined here have pointers as data members and need to have copy constructors. 
  I just didn’t ask you to do it for OnlineSuperMaqrket and FruitStation classes)
 
 Destructor: output a message “Destroyed Fruit …., quantity = ….” 
 and then free memory for the fruit name data
 
 Public functions:
 get/set functions for all data. Note fruit name is a pointer. 
 You must do dynamica memory allocation for the setFruitName function
 
 static function getTax that returns the static tax field
 
 Note: You may declare fruit name as a string thus no need to provide a copy constructor for the class. In this case you will lose 10 points for not implementing pointer for this data. In fact I recommend you implement it this way first to get your program going.
 If you have time then provide pointer implementation later to get full credit.
